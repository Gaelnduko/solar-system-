                        <p>Whats the weather like out there? We mean waaaay out there in our solar system <br> where the forecast might not be quite what you think. 
                         Lets <br> look at the mean temperature of the Sun, and the planets in our solar system.<br> The mean temperature is the average temperature over the surface of the rocky planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. <br> Dwarf planet Pluto also has a solid surface. But since the gas giants donâ€™t have a surface, the mean is the average temperature at <br> what would be equivalent at sea level on Earth <img src="https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/solar-system-thermometer.jpg?resize=768,1190" alt="solar "></p>
